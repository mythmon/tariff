[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mythmon/tariff.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mythmon/tariff)

Tariff sorts through your Python imports and tells you if you put them in the
wrong order. It is a linting tool.

It is intended to be compatible with Python 2.7, Python 3.3, and PyPy. These
are all tested with continous integrations from Travis.
